title: A Shiny App honoring Pi
---

With March 14 looming on the horizon I decided to make a little interactive visualizaton on how to approximate Pi by randomly generating points in a square. This is a certainly [not a novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) idea but I think it touches on two really important topics: the nature of volume/area and the nature of uncertainty/randomness and it does so in an accesible and engaging way. Hopefully we'll see more interactive tools in math and science classes - I think they have a lot of potential.

Anyways check the app out below! It might take a few seconds to load.
